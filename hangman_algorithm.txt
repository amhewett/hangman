Objective: The objective of this program is to make a hangman game. 

Algorithm: 
    1) Define a function that randomly selects a word from a text dictionary/list
    2) Define a function that takes input from the user for each letter guessed
    3) Define a function that will take the letter guessed correctly
     and turns it into a string
    4) Create variables to store data that the user enters
        a) create a variable that stores the word that the computer picks
        b) create a variable that holds the letters correct and a variable for
        letters that are incorrect
    5) Display an introduction to the program so the users will know what to do
    6) Create a while loop so the users can guess until they win, or run out of 
    tries
    7) Add statements at the beginning and the end of the game to welcome 
    users to the game and thank users for playing it
